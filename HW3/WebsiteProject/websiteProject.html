        <p> We decided to divide the assignment into 4 pieces and everyone received their part to complete until a fixed deadline of ours. There have been a lot of complications along the way, which will be provided below in the form of The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. </p>
    </div>

<div class="goodBadUgly">
    <h1 class="good">The Good</h2>
    <p class="x">After we have decided who is doing which part, everything was going smoothly. Everyone had a quite steady pace and easily were going to meet the deadline, which we've set ourselves. </p>
</div>

<div class="goodBadUgly">
    <h1 class="bad">The Bad</h2>
    <p class="x">After a while, on the day of a deadline, when we should've sent all our finished files, some of us couldn't manage to finish everything on time, so we set the new deadline a couple of days later. One day before the second deadline, one of our teammates informed us about his accident and him currently being in the hospital. This was a major hit to our group as we needed to finish a 4-person project with only 3 people remaining. Afterwards, we found out that our 3rd member was dramatically behind a schedule and haven't even started coding his part.  </p>
</div>

<div class="goodBadUgly">
    <h1 class="ugly">The Ugly</h2>
    <p class="x">As we were very tight on time, we couldn't wait for a third member to finish his courses and ,only then, start coding. So, basically, we were left with 2 people and each of us had to take double the load we were intended to. We had to stay up till late night to be able to finish our assignment, but thankfully, together, we managed to finish everything on time.</p>

<div class="overall">
    <p>Overall, we believe that this assignment was a very good practice for us to learn the basics of HTML & CSS.
	Apart from all the complications and obstacles, it surely, was a very engaging and productive journey. 
	We are looking forward for more assignments of this kind! </p>
