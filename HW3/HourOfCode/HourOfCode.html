<header>
    
<p>Our Hour Of Code project took place on December the 8th at 18:00 with a total of 50 participants. Even though participants were in 6th grade, nearly all showed a very deep interest for what was being presented. Our team consists of 4 members and every single one of us had a specific role in the presentation: </p>

	<p>We faced several problems along our journey ,such as finding the school and managing time. Initially, we wanted to conduct our presentation in 132-134 Education Complex. After one of the graduates, Kenan Kadirov, contacted teachers to establish the time of the presentation, we have noticed that another group had already taken that school. Surely, we had to act cleverly and rapidly, as we were tight on time. We <em>immediately</em> started searching for other suitable schools and, thankfully, our team leader, Ibrahim Valizada, managed to find an appropriate school just on time.</p>

	<h2>During the Project</h2>
	<p>The project lasted for about an hour, yet, it was perfectly decent to deliver all the information we intended to and motivate children to further investigate in the topic of programming. We took into an account that since age group of listeners wasn't great, we were ought to present the information in an understandable and reachable way.</p>
	<h3>Here are some images from the project:</h3>
<!-- Ibrahim, include several of them here -->

	<p>As it can be seen, the images were not complex, on the contrary, they were children-friendly and easy to grasp. Additionally, our speech was no different! We didn't use any profound statements and tried to organize our speech in a cleanest way possible. </p>
	<br>    <p>Moreover, after finishing the Hour of Code session we have posted additional recordings on FaceBook. You can find one of the posts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100060003816579/videos/102028918473902/">here.</a></p>
	<br>
	<p>By the end of our presentation, right before the Q&A session, our team member, Zaka Shahmurzada, presented the ADA University to the listeners by providing them with information and breathtaking statistics of our beloved university.</p>
</div>
<div class="QandA">
    <h2>Q&A Session</h2>
	<p>After we hosted our presentation, we had an amazing Q&A session with all participants. We could see how everyone was exited to learn more about programming. We received an excessive amount of questions in chat box, as well as numerous oral questions. Despite the large amount of questions, we managed to answer most of them, leaving no confusion behind.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Overall, the Hour Of Code Project was definitely an interesting experience, for both participants and us. We believe that we inspired children to acquire an interest in this field, or at least, do a research about coding in general ! </p>
